    abstract = {{Clay, the major ingredient of natural soils, is used as a rheological modifier while formulating paints and coatings. When subjected to desiccation, colloidal clay suspensions and clayey soils crack due to the accumulation of drying-induced stresses. Even when desiccation is suppressed, aqueous clay suspensions exhibit physical aging, with their elastic and viscous moduli increasing over time as the clay particles self-assemble into gel-like networks due to time-dependent inter-particle screened electrostatic interactions. The rate of evolution of the suspension structures and therefore of the mechanical moduli can be controlled by changing clay concentration or by incorporating additives. Since physical aging and desiccation should both contribute to the consolidation of drying clay suspensions, we manipulate the desiccation process via alterations of clay and additive concentrations. For a desiccating sample with an accelerated rate of aging, we observe faster consolidation into a semi-solid state and earlier onset of cracks. We estimate the crack onset time,  tc, in direct visualization experiments and the elasticity of the drying sample layer, E, using microindentation in an atomic force microscope. We demonstrate that  tc∝GcE, where  Gc, the fracture energy, is estimated by fitting our experimental data to a linear poroelastic model that incorporates the Griffith's criterion for crack formation. Our work demonstrates that early crack onset is associated with lower sample ductility. The correlation between crack onset in a sample and its mechanical properties as uncovered here is potentially useful in preparing crack-resistant coatings and diverse clay structures.}},

abstract = {{The growth of interfacial instabilities during fluid displacements can be driven by gradients in pressure, viscosity and surface tension, and by applying external fields. Since displacements of non-Newtonian fluids such as polymer solutions, colloidal and granular slurries are ubiquitous in natural and industrial processes, understanding the growth mechanisms and fully developed morphologies of interfacial patterns involving non-Newtonian fluids is extremely important. In this perspective, we focus on displacement experiments, wherein competitions between capillary, viscous, elastic and frictional forces drive the onset and growth of primarily viscous fingering instabilities in confined geometries. We conclude by highlighting several exciting open problems in this research area.}}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
