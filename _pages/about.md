I am a PhD student specialising in soft condensed matter physics. During my Ph.D., I was studying pattern formation in non-equilibrium colloidal and athermal suspensions. I have studied clay adsorption on a colloidal microsphere and active microrheology of clay suspensions using optical tweezers. Additionally, I have studied viscous fingering instabilities during displacements of clay suspensions, desiccation crack formation in clay suspensions, and self-assembly of soft colloids at the air-water interface.

I have experties in using experimental techniques like rheology, scanning electron microscopy, optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, and digital imaging to study colloidal suspensions in different non-equilibrium environments.
